# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized. 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. **Python**: Widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. Popular libraries include NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

2. **R**: Commonly used for statistical analysis and data visualization. It has a rich ecosystem of packages such as ggplot2 and dplyr.

3. **SQL**: Essential for working with databases and querying structured data. Data scientists often use SQL to extract, transform, and analyze data stored in relational databases.

4. **Julia**: Known for its speed and performance, Julia is gaining popularity in data science, especially for tasks involving numerical and scientific computing.

5. **Scala**: Often used with Apache Spark for large-scale data processing and analysis.

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:

1. **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.

2. **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It offers data structures like DataFrames for efficient data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.

3. **scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.

4. **Matplotlib**: A widely-used 2D plotting library for Python. It allows data visualization through various charts and plots.

5. **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for statistical data visualization. It is particularly useful for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.


```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)
```

```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)

```
